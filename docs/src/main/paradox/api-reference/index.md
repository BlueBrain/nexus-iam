# API Reference

As with the rest of the Nexus platform, the IAM service exposes a RESTful interface over HTTP(S) for synchronous
communication. 
The generally adopted transport format is JSON based.

The service handles @ref:[access control lists](acls.md) and identifies users through third party providers via
its own @ref:[authentication](auth.md) interface.
